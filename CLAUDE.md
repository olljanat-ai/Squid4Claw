# CLAUDE.md - Firewall4AI

## Project Overview
Firewall4AI is a transparent firewall/proxy that controls AI agent internet access from isolated VM environments. It sits between agent VMs and the internet, intercepting all HTTP/HTTPS traffic transparently via iptables without requiring proxy configuration on agent VMs.

## Architecture
- **Single Go binary**, zero external dependencies (stdlib only)
- **Three listeners**: HTTP proxy (:8080), transparent TLS (:8443), admin UI (:443)
- **iptables REDIRECT**: Port 80 -> :8080, port 443 -> :8443 for transparent interception
- **TLS MITM**: Auto-generated CA signs per-host certificates; agents must trust the CA
- **Default-deny**: All connections blocked until admin approves
- **Three-level approval**: Global (all agents/VMs) -> VM-specific (by source IP) -> Skill-specific (by skill token, for getting more permissions). Used for both host approvals and image approvals.
- **Container registry awareness**: Transparent proxy detects Docker Registry V2 traffic to configured registry hosts and applies per-image approval instead of per-host approval. No Docker mirror config needed on agent VMs.
- **VM appliance**: Debian 13 ISO built with Elemental Toolkit, two NICs (eth0=internet, eth1=agent network 10.255.255.0/24)
- **Immutable OS**: Elemental Toolkit provides immutable rootfs with btrfs snapshots and OTA upgrades via container images
- **Persistent storage**: Rules (state.json), CA certificates, DHCP leases, and logs stored on COS_PERSISTENT partition
- **Permanent DHCP leases**: Agents get stable IPs for reliable VM-specific approvals

## Building and Testing
```bash
make build           # Build the binary
make test            # Run all tests
make lint            # Run go vet
go test ./...        # Run tests directly

# Build ISO (requires Docker)
docker build . --build-arg VERSION=dev -t firewall4ai:dev
docker create --name export firewall4ai:dev
mkdir rootfs && docker export export | tar -x -C rootfs && docker rm export
sudo ./rootfs/usr/bin/elemental --debug build-iso --bootloader-in-rootfs --extra-cmdline "" dir:rootfs

# Upgrade existing installation
elemental upgrade --reboot --system oci:ghcr.io/olljanat-ai/firewall4ai:<version>
```

## Key Design Decisions
- **Transparent proxy mode**: iptables REDIRECT intercepts agent traffic; no proxy config needed on agent VMs. Agents can optionally still use explicit proxy mode.
- **Three-level approvals**: Approvals are checked broadest-first: (1) Global (`skill_id=""`, `source_ip=""`) applies to all agents on all VMs. (2) VM-specific (`skill_id=""`, `source_ip` set) applies to all agents on that VM. (3) Skill-specific (`skill_id` set) gives additional permissions beyond global/VM. Broader approvals cascade to notify narrower waiters.
- **URL path prefix**: Approvals can optionally restrict access to specific URL path prefixes (e.g., `github.com` with `path_prefix="/olljanat-ai/"` allows only that org's repos). Empty `PathPrefix` means all paths (backward compatible). When multiple approvals match, the most specific (longest PathPrefix) wins. For CONNECT+MITM, any path-specific approval implies host-level tunnel access; per-request path checks enforce restrictions inside the tunnel.
- **Anonymous access**: Agents can make requests without skill tokens. These go through the global/VM approval system. Invalid tokens are rejected; missing tokens are anonymous.
- **GUID tokens**: Skill tokens use UUID v4 format (e.g., `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-4789-abcd-ef0123456789`). Skill IDs can be user-provided or auto-generated GUIDs.
- **State persistence**: All state (skills, approvals, credentials, image approvals) stored in a single `state.json` file, loaded at startup, saved on mutations and shutdown.
- **Registry integration**: Configured registry hosts are detected in the transparent proxy. Manifest requests (`/v2/{name}/manifests/{ref}`) trigger image-level approval. Blob requests are allowed at repo level once any image in that repo is approved. All other registry traffic (auth endpoints, /v2/ pings, CDN) is auto-approved since the registry is configured explicitly.

## Common Patterns
- **Thread safety**: All managers use `sync.RWMutex`. Read operations use `RLock`, write operations use `Lock`.
- **Approval flow**: `Check(host, skillID, sourceIP, pathPrefix)` registers a pending entry, `WaitForDecision()` blocks until admin decides or timeout, `Decide()` notifies all waiters via channels with cascading (global notifies VM/skill waiters, host-only notifies path-specific waiters and vice versa).
- **Path matching**: `CheckExistingWithPath(host, path, skillID, sourceIP)` scans approvals using host wildcards and path prefix matching with longest-prefix-wins semantics. `CheckExistingForHost()` checks if any approval exists for a host regardless of path (used for CONNECT+MITM tunnel decisions). `MatchPath(prefix, path)` returns true if the request path starts with the prefix.
- **Source IP extraction**: `extractSourceIP()` in proxy.go strips the port from `RemoteAddr` to get the VM's IP for approval lookups.
- **Test helpers**: `setupProxy(t)` creates a test proxy with 50ms approval timeout. `setupProxyWithCA(t)` adds a CA for MITM tests. Registry tests use `setupProxy(t, upstream)` with a mock upstream `httptest.Server`.
- **Image approval**: Uses a second `approval.Manager` instance. `Host` field holds image references (e.g., `docker.io/library/ubuntu:latest`). `CheckExistingWithMatcher()` enables custom pattern matching via `registry.MatchImageRef()` which supports `docker.io/library/*` and `docker.io/library/ubuntu:*` wildcards.
- **Registry utilities**: `registry.ParsePath()` extracts name+reference from V2 API URLs. `registry.RegistryForHost()` looks up the registry config for a hostname. `registry.ParseImageRef()` constructs full image references. These are used by `handleRegistryTLSRequest()` in the proxy.
- **No external dependencies**: Everything uses Go stdlib. Don't add third-party packages.

## When Making Changes
- Run `go test ./...` after changes; all tests should pass
- The proxy handles three modes: explicit HTTP proxy, explicit CONNECT/MITM, and transparent TLS interception
- The `checkApproval(host, path, skill, sourceIP)` function checks: pre-approved hosts -> global approvals -> VM-specific approvals -> skill-specific approvals -> register pending and wait. Path-aware matching uses longest-prefix-wins semantics.
- For CONNECT+MITM, `checkHostApproval()` allows the tunnel if any approval (host-only or path-specific) exists; per-request path checks happen in `handleMITMRequest()`. For blind tunnels (no MITM), only host-level approval is checked.
- All approval methods take four identifiers: `host`, `skillID`, `sourceIP`, `pathPrefix`. The approval key is `sourceIP|skillID|host|pathPrefix`.
- The admin UI is vanilla JS with no build step; changes to `web/static/` are embedded at compile time via `go:embed`
- VM appliance is built as a Debian 13 ISO via Elemental Toolkit (Dockerfile + `elemental build-iso`)
- System config: iptables rules in `scripts/`, dnsmasq config in `config/dnsmasq/`, network in `config/network/`
- Persistent data (state.json, CA certs, logs, DHCP leases) survives reboots/upgrades via COS_PERSISTENT partition
- OTA upgrades via `elemental upgrade --system oci:<image>` using the pushed container image from GHCR
- The transparent proxy detects registry hosts via `registry.RegistryForHost()` and routes to `handleRegistryTLSRequest()` for image-level approval instead of host-level
- Image approvals use a second `approval.Manager` instance, persisted as `image_approvals` in state.json
- Image approvals follow the same three-level pattern as host approvals; the `Host` field contains the image reference (e.g., `docker.io/library/ubuntu:latest`)
- Registry config is in `config.json` under `registries` array; each entry has `name` and `hosts` (all associated hostnames: registry API, auth, CDN)
- All configured registry hosts are auto-approved for network access; the real access control is per-image
